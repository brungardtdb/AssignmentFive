# Operation5
A Java application that simulates a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. I got tired of creating all of my assignments as console applications so I decided to play around with Java's built-in GUI!. I also got to use an enumeratiom in this application, which I was also pretty excited about. The application asks you how many rounds you'd like to play (you must pick an odd number so there is a clear winner, or it will ask you to pick again). If you enter "Spock", there is a special message displayed claiming that Spock is the ultimate, but is not allowed because he maintains an unfair advantage. Other than that, if the user doesn't select a valid option, they will be prompted to choose again. If the word isn't capitalized, the application will still recognize the input. The computer's choice is displayed, as is the winner of each round. The final score is tallied up at the end and the final winner is displayed for the user to see.
